# Inclinometer-Data-Logger
Here is a cheap, simple system for logging incline and acceleration underwater using the Adafruit adalogger and the LSM303 triple-axis accelerometer.

This project was derived from a need to have a cheap sensor which would measure and log the angle of an grid on a commercial fish trawl.  This system is based on the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Adalogger and the LSM303 triple-axis accelerometer and magnetometer board. The adalogger is a tremendously useful little Arduino compatible micro-controller with a built-in SD card for easy data logging.
